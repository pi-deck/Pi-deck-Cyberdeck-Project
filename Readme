A project by a 12 year old to make a Apache 1800 Cyberdeck with a Raspberry Pi 4B with 4gb ram, loosely based on Jay Doschers' Raspberry Pi Quick kit.
Trying to run Windows 10 like @mariobalanica but with less bugs. Need wifi support and touchscreen compatibility.
Will also try to run similar os, like ZorinOS or elementaryOS.
